### SOLID
- SRP - single responsibility
- OCP - open cloas (open for extendibility, close for modification)
- LISCOW - parent should able substitute a child without any side effects
- IG - interface aggregation (child should not forced to implement something he does not want , create another interface and use multiple inheritance)
- DI - dependency injection
